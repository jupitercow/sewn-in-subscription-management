# Sewn In Subscription Manager

Allow users to manage subscriptions for the Sewn In Messenger plugin. Can be used to easily manage other subscriptions as well, you just have to check the what the user has chosen before sending mail. This really just creates an interface for unsubscribing, it doesn't actually do anything more than set usermeta data that can be used by other functions.
